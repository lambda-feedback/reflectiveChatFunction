# Lambda Feedback Chat Function Boilerplate

This repository contains the code needed to develop a modular chatbot to be used on Lambda-Feedback platform [written in Python]. The chat function consumes the [muEd API](https://mued.org/) request schema — the `context`, `user`, and `messages` fields in incoming requests follow the muEd format and are translated into a tutoring prompt by `src/agent/context.py`.

## Deployment
[![Create Release Request](https://img.shields.io/badge/Create%20Release%20Request-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/lambda-feedback/{REPO_NAME_HERE}/issues/new?template=release-request.yml)

To deploy to production, update the README button above to point to the correct repository.

## Quickstart

This chapter helps you to quickly set up a new Python chat module function using this repository.

> [!NOTE]
> To develop this function further, you will require the following environment variables in your `.env` file:
```bash
> If you use OpenAI:
OPENAI_API_KEY
OPENAI_MODEL

> If you use GoogleAI:
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY
GOOGLE_AI_MODEL
```
> If you use OpenRouter:
```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY
OPENROUTER_MODEL
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you decide to use other providers like Azure OpenAI or Ollama, you will need to update the workflow files and the `llm_factory.py` file to include the necessary environment variables for those providers.

> For monitoring of the LLM calls (follow instructions on how to set up on langsmith online):
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2
LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT
```

#### 1. Create a new repository
In GitHub, choose Use this template > Create a new repository in the repository toolbar.

Choose the owner, and pick a name for the new repository.

> [!IMPORTANT] If you want to deploy the chat function to Lambda Feedback, make sure to choose the `Lambda Feedback` organization as the owner.

Set the visibility to `Public` or `Private`.

> [!IMPORTANT] If you want to use GitHub deployment protection rules, make sure to set the visibility to `Public`.

Click on Create repository.

#### 2. Clone the new repository
Clone the new repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

#### 3. Develop the chat function

You're ready to start developing your chat function. Head over to the [Development](#development) section to learn more.

#### 4. Deploy the chat function

You will have to add your API key and LLM model name into the Github repo settings. Under `Secrets and variables/Actions`: the API key must be added as a secret and the LLM model must be added as a variable.

You must ensure the same namings as in your `.env` file. So, make sure to update the `.github/workflows/{staging-deploy,production-deploy,test-lint}.yml` files with the correct parameter names. 

For more information, check the section below [Deploy to Lambda Feedback](#deploy-to-lambda-feedback).

#### 5. Update the README

In the `README.md` file, change the title and description so it fits the purpose of your chat function.

Also, don't forget to update or delete the Quickstart chapter from the `README.md` file after you've completed these steps.

## Development

To modify the behaviour of the chatbot, simply edit the prompts in `src/agent/prompts.py`. Or if you want to create a custom agent, copy or update the `agent.py` from `src/agent/` and edit it to match your LLM agent requirements. Import the new invocation in the `module.py` file.

Your agent can be based on an LLM hosted anywhere. OpenAI, Google AI, Azure OpenAI, and Ollama are available out of the box via `src/agent/llm_factory.py`, and you can add your own provider there too.

The agent uses **two separate LLM instances** — `self.llm` for chat responses and `self.summarisation_llm` for conversation summarisation and style analysis. By default both use the same provider, but you can point them at different models (e.g. a cheaper or faster model for summarisation) by changing the class in `agent.py`.

## Testing the Chat Function

To test your function, you can run the unit tests, call the code directly through a python script, or build the respective chat function docker container locally and call it through an API request. Below you can find details on those processes.

### Run Unit Tests

You can run the unit tests using `pytest`. Run it from the repository root with `PYTHONPATH=.` set (as CI does) so the `tests` and `src` packages resolve correctly:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest
```

### Run the Chat Script

You can run the Python function itself directly — `index.py` wires `chat_module`/`chat_health_module` into `lf_toolkit`'s RPC server, the same way shimmy invokes it inside the container. This requires the `EVAL_IO`/`EVAL_RPC_TRANSPORT` environment variables shimmy would normally set (see `lf_toolkit`'s docs), so prefer the Docker or `manual_agent_run.py` routes below for everyday testing.

```bash
python index.py
```

You can also use the `manual_agent_run.py` script to test the agents with example inputs from Lambda Feedback questions and synthetic conversations.
```bash
python tests/manual_agent_run.py
```

### Calling the Docker Image Locally

To build the Docker image, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t llm_chat .
```

#### Running the Docker Image

To run the Docker image, use the following command:

##### A. Without .env file:

```bash
docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY={your key} -e OPENAI_MODEL={your LLM model name} -p 8080:8080 llm_chat
```

##### B. With container name (for interaction, e.g. copying file from inside the docker container):

```bash
docker run --env-file .env -it --name my-lambda-container -p 8080:8080 llm_chat
```

This starts shimmy (the [Lambda Feedback shim](https://github.com/lambda-feedback/shimmy)) as the container's entrypoint, which spawns this function as a worker subprocess and exposes it on port `8080` as the muEd chat API:

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/chat' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-Api-Version: 0.1.0' \
--data '{"messages": [{"role": "USER", "content": "hi"}]}'
```

Health check:

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/chat/health' \
--header 'X-Api-Version: 0.1.0'
```

#### Call Docker Container
##### A. Call Docker with Python Requests

In the `tests/` folder you can find the `manual_agent_requests.py` script that calls the `/chat` and `/chat/health` routes of the running docker container. It reads any kind of input files with the expected schema. You can use this to test your curl calls of the chatbot.

##### B. Call Docker Container through API request

POST URL:

```bash
http://localhost:8080/chat
```

Per the [muEd `ChatRequest` schema](https://mued.org/), only `messages` is required; `conversationId`, `user`, `context`, and `configuration` are all optional. Requests may include an `X-Api-Version: 0.1.0` header.

**Minimal request — only required components:**

```JSON
{"messages": [{"role": "USER", "content": "hi"}]}
```

**Full request as Lambda Feedback sends it** — all optional fields populated:
```json

  "conversationId": "<uuid>",
  "messages": [
    { "role": "USER", "content": "<previous user message>" },
    { "role": "ASSISTANT", "content": "<previous assistant reply>" },

### Deploy to Lambda Feedback

Deploying the chat function to Lambda Feedback is simple and straightforward, as long as the repository is within the [Lambda Feedback organization](https://github.com/lambda-feedback).

The pipeline has two environments: **staging** and **production**.

**Staging** — Pushing to the `main` branch triggers the [Staging deploy workflow](.github/workflows/staging-deploy.yml), which runs the test suite and (on success) deploys the chat function to AWS staging. After deploying, please contact one of the Lambda Feedback admins to allow the function to be accessible on `staging.lambdafeedback.com`.

> [!WARNING] The staging environment of the platform is always under use and may include beta/in-testing features that can cause unexpected issues.

**Production** — Once you are happy with the staging deployment, run the [Production deploy workflow](.github/workflows/production-deploy.yml) manually from the GitHub Actions tab. Pick a `version-bump` (`patch`/`minor`/`major`); the workflow will redeploy staging, then pause on a manual approval gate (the `production-override` GitHub Environment, reviewed by a Lambda Feedback admin), then create a `vX.Y.Z` git tag + GitHub Release and deploy to the main [Lambda Feedback platform](https://www.lambdafeedback.com/).

**Pull requests** — The [Test and Lint workflow](.github/workflows/test-lint.yml) runs the test suite on every PR; no deploy.

> [!NOTE] Once a deployment has been successful, share your necessary environment variables (e.g. API key and LLM model) with one of the Lambda Feedback team members.

## Troubleshooting

### Containerized Function Fails to Start

If your chat function is working fine when run locally, but not when containerized, there is much more to consider. Here are some common issues and solution approaches:

**Run-time dependencies**

Make sure that all run-time dependencies are installed in the Docker image.

- Python packages: Make sure to add the dependency to the `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` file, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `poetry install` in the Dockerfile.
- System packages: If you need to install system packages, add the installation command to the Dockerfile.
- ML models: If your chat function depends on ML models, make sure to include them in the Docker image.
- Data files: If your chat function depends on data files, make sure to include them in the Docker image.
