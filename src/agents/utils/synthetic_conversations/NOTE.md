For evaluation purposes of the developed agent, you can use `synthetic_conversation_generation.py` to review the performance of your LLM tutor by running a multi-agent communication with a student agent (available in `src/agents/`).

This folder contains all the synthetic conversations generated by an LLM student discussing with an LLM tutor.
The files are generated by running the `synthetic_conversation_generation.py`.
